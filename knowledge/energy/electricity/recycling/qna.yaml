    on their weight. At that time, the national provisions (i.e. the Act of 11 May
    2001 on the obligations of businesses regarding the management of certain waste
    and on product charges and deposits (Journal of Laws 2007/90, item 607, as amended))
    required operators marketing batteries and accumulators to report information
    only on the quantity of batteries and accumulators placed on the market and not
    on their weight. It is not currently possible to process this data in such a way
    as to give the actual weight of portable batteries and accumulators placed on
    the market in that period. Accordingly, the data taken into account in this report
    concern the period 2010-2012.

    in 2010-2012, with 11 Member States also reporting that they are putting in place
    measures that would go over and above the provisions of Article 14. Doubts remain
    with regards to some of the countries (specifically Finland, Hungary, Luxembourg
    or Sweden), because of the lack of detail in their replies regarding the measures
    adopted or lack of information regarding the link between the existing measures
    and the obligations of the Directive. It is worth noting that despite Member States
    reporting that they have adopted a series of measures, this does not necessarily
    mean that these have been implemented on the ground.

    as requested by the question, as well as any information on treatment conditions.
    Ireland's reply did not give any quantitative figures either nor did it mention
    sound evidence on the recycling operations taking place in the countries it exported
    to. It also noted in its reply that waste batteries and accumulators are only
    exported for treatment within the EU, which contradicts data that was found on
    EUROSTAT that showed records of 446 tonnes of lead batteries being exported to
    South Korea in 2010. Luxembourg did not provide any tonnage figures or provide
    any evidence on the recycling operations abroad although it did note that all

    question: Why were the replies from Denmark, Greece, Latvia, and Poland not included
      in the Final Implementation Report for Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and

    question: Which countries' responses were included in the Final Implementation
      Report for Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators for the years
      2010-2012?
- context: '## 4.1 Identified Limitations of Reporting Despite that fact that Article
    22 of the Directive itself requires that Member States report to the Commission
    on the implementation of the Directive on a three yearly basis via an Implementation
    Questionnaire format, not all Member States treat this obligation with the same
    level of due attention. The Implementation Questionnaire aims to set out a framework
    to capture clear and reliable information regarding the Batteries Directive in
    each Member State, but given the open-ended nature of most questions, and the
    lack of detail in terms of what the Commission is expecting to see in each reply
    makes it often difficult to compare the information provided across Member States.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The main challenge in comparing the information provided by Member States
      in the Implementation Questionnaire is due to the open-ended nature of most
      questions, and the lack of detail in terms of what the Commission is expecting
      to see in each reply.
    question: What is the main challenge in comparing the information provided by
      Member States in the Implementation Questionnaire?
  - answer: Article 22 of the Directive requires that Member States report to the
      Commission on the implementation of the Directive on a three yearly basis.
    question: What is the frequency of reporting by Member States to the Commission
      on the implementation of the Batteries Directive?
  - answer: The Implementation Questionnaire aims to set out a framework to capture
      clear and reliable information regarding the Batteries Directive in each Member
      State.
    question: What is the purpose of the Implementation Questionnaire in the context
      of the Batteries Directive?
- context: For example, quite a few Member States in response to the question on whether
    they had exported waste batteries and accumulators between third countries in
    2010-2012, responded that they had done so but only between EU Member States.
    This is not captured comprehensively by the Implementation Questionnaire as it
    currently stands.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: No, according to the information provided, only exports between EU Member
      States were reported.
    question: Did any Member State export waste batteries and accumulators between
      third countries in 2010-2012?
  - answer: No, the current Implementation Questionnaire does not capture this comprehensively.
    question: Is the Implementation Questionnaire comprehensive in capturing exports
      of waste batteries and accumulators between Member States in 2010-2012?
  - answer: The information provided does not specify the type of waste batteries
      and accumulators that were exported between EU Member States in 2010-2012.
    question: What type of waste batteries and accumulators exports were reported
      between EU Member States in 2010-2012?
- context: As expected those Member States that did not have any treatment or recycling
    facilities domestically are those which reported that they had exported all of
    their collected batteries and accumulators such as Cyprus and Hungary. However
    a number of Member States with treatment facilities domestically have also reported
    that they have been exporting their waste batteries and accumulators for treatment
    elsewhere in the EU.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Cyprus and Hungary
    question: Which Member States did not have any treatment or recycling facilities
      domestically?
  - answer: They were exported all of them
    question: What happened to the collected batteries and accumulators of Member
      States that did not have any treatment or recycling facilities domestically?
  - answer: 'Yes'
    question: Are there any Member States with treatment facilities domestically that
      have also reported that they have been exporting their waste batteries and accumulators
      for treatment elsewhere in the EU?
- context: Given the limitations in reporting with regards to this question, this
    could be an area that might benefit from better quality and more comprehensive
    data in the future. Furthermore, Member State replies vary from the detailed to
    those which only make reference to national legislation. The majority of Member
    States tended to report whether measures had been transposed into national law
    but did not comment on if actions had proved effective or led to improvements
    in practice. In addition replies were inconsistent in terms of quantifying different
    aspects of implementation resulting in an inability to compare performance across
    Member States. In some cases data was missing for certain Member States, and in
    other cases it was difficult to ascertain what the intended correct reply was.
    These limitations made comparisons between Member States even more challenging.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The limitations in reporting with regards to this question, inconsistencies
      in replies, missing data for certain Member States, and an inability to quantify
      different aspects of implementation make comparisons between Member States even
      more challenging.
    question: Why is it difficult to compare the performance of Member States in terms
      of implementing certain measures?
  - answer: The majority of Member States tend to report whether measures have been
      transposed into national law but do not comment on if actions have proved effective
      or led to improvements in practice.
    question: What kind of information is typically provided by Member States in their
      responses regarding the implementation of certain measures?
  - answer: The inconsistencies in terms of quantifying different aspects of implementation
      result from the lack of comprehensive data and the varying quality of reporting.
    question: Why are the replies from Member States inconsistent in terms of quantifying
      different aspects of implementation?
- context: The most serious issue in this regard was that Denmark, Greece, Latvia
    and Poland did not submit replies to the Implementation Questionnaires for 2010-2012.
    A further limitation is that in certain instances questions have multiple parts,
    yet Member States' replies ignore whole aspects of the question.

      and Poland did not submit replies to the Implementation Questionnaires for 2010-2012.
    question: Why did Denmark, Greece, Latvia, and Poland not submit replies to the
      Implementation Questionnaires for 2010-2012?
  - answer: A further limitation is that in certain instances questions have multiple
      parts, yet Member States' replies ignore whole aspects of the question.
    question: What is a limitation in the replies to the Implementation Questionnaires?
  - answer: In such cases, it means that the Member State's reply does not provide
      a complete answer to the question.
    question: What happens when a question in the Implementation Questionnaires has
      multiple parts and the Member State's reply ignores some parts?
- context: For example, very few countries mentioned for how many of the exported
    waste batteries and accumulators they had sound evidence that the recycling operations
    took place in the countries they were exported to under conditions equivalent
    to the requirements of this Directive in line with Article 15 (i.e.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Very few countries
    question: Which countries have sound evidence that the recycling operations of
      exported waste batteries and accumulators took place in the countries they were
      exported to under conditions equivalent to the requirements of this Directive
      in line with Article 15?
  - answer: The conditions must be equivalent to the requirements of this Directive
    question: What specific conditions must the recycling operations of exported waste
      batteries and accumulators meet in the countries they are exported to in line
      with Article 15 of this Directive?
  - answer: Very few
    question: What is the minimum number of countries that have sound evidence of
      meeting the conditions for recycling operations of exported waste batteries
      and accumulators in line with Article 15 of this Directive?
- context: Question 7 ). Similarly Member State replies did not necessarily respond
    to all requirements of the specific article such as Article 21 on labelling (i.e.
    Question 10(a) ). Furthermore some instances of contradictions between the Implementation
    Questionnaire replies or between these replies and other data sources considered
    were identified.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The information provided suggests that Member States did not necessarily
      respond to all requirements of Article 21 on labelling due to various reasons
      that are not explicitly stated.
    question: Why did some Member States not respond to all requirements of Article
      21 on labelling?
  - answer: Yes, according to the information provided, some instances of contradictions
      between the Implementation Questionnaire replies were identified.
    question: Were there any instances of contradictions between the Implementation
      Questionnaire replies?
  - answer: Yes, according to the information provided, some instances of contradictions
      between the Implementation Questionnaire replies and other data sources considered
      were identified.
    question: Were there any contradictions between the Implementation Questionnaire
      replies and other data sources considered?
- context: For example Austria reported in its reply to Question 7 that no waste batteries
    or accumulators were exported for recovery to third countries when in a previous
    reply provided a tonnage figure for the amount of portable batteries that were
    exported. Furthermore, when considering the EPBA study (2013) which provided collection
    rates for waste batteries and accumulators across the EU27 for 2012, these values
    were in certain cases different to the figures submitted by the Member States
    themselves in their replies (i.e.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Austria reported that no waste batteries or accumulators were exported
      for recovery to third countries.
    question: What did Austria report about the export of waste batteries or accumulators
      for recovery to third countries?
  - answer: Yes, in certain cases the values provided by the EPBA study were different
      from the figures submitted by the Member States themselves.
    question: Were the collection rates for waste batteries and accumulators across
      the EU27 for 2012 provided by the EPBA study different from the figures submitted
      by the Member States themselves?
  - answer: Yes, Austria provided a tonnage figure for the amount of portable batteries
      that were exported in a previous reply.
    question: Did Austria provide a tonnage figure for the amount of portable batteries
      that were exported in a previous reply?
- context: Question 4 ). There were also Member States with regional differences such
    as Belgium, where each province has different approaches for the implementation
    of the Directive. In these cases regional summaries have been given based on the
    information submitted, although it was not always possible to deal with individual
    regions in the same level of detail as individual Member States. Finally there
    were also instances of differing interpretations of questions in the Implementation
    Questionnaire by Member States.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: There were regional differences in the implementation of the Directive
      in Belgium due to each province having different approaches for the implementation.
    question: Why were there regional differences in the implementation of the Directive
      in Belgium?
  - answer: Regional summaries were given in cases of regional differences based on
      the information submitted, although it was not always possible to deal with
      individual regions in the same level of detail as individual Member States.
    question: Why were regional summaries given in cases of regional differences?
  - answer: Member States had differing interpretations of questions in the Implementation
      Questionnaire.
    question: Why did Member States have differing interpretations of questions in
      the Implementation Questionnaire?
- context: An example is Question 8 (b) which considers the establishment of measures
    to avoid double charging producers. Some Member States considered that it was
    compulsory to have such measures in place and went on to describe these, whereas
    others simply responded that no such measures were necessary.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Some Member States have measures in place to avoid double charging producers.
      The specifics of these measures were described in their responses.
    question: What measures are in place to avoid double charging producers in some
      Member States?
  - answer: Yes, some Member States consider it compulsory to have measures in place
      to avoid double charging producers.
    question: Are there any Member States that consider it compulsory to have measures
      to avoid double charging producers?
  - answer: No, according to the information provided, there are Member States that
      responded that no such measures were necessary.
    question: Are there any Member States that do not consider it necessary to have
      measures to avoid double charging producers?
- context: '## 4.2 Suggestions for Impr oving Member State Reporting With the aim
    being to improve the quality of the Member State reporting, the European Commission
    might consider how best to refine the questions in the Implementation Questionnaire
    to ensure more comparable replies across the Member States. An example is Question
    8 (b) as outlined above. One such revision could be the introduction of a word
    limit to ensure that all Member States provide comparable levels of detail in
    their replies.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The European Commission could refine the questions in the Implementation
      Questionnaire to ensure more comparable replies across the Member States.
    question: What is one way the European Commission could improve the quality of
      Member State reporting?
  - answer: Question 8 (b) as outlined above.
    question: What is an example of a question that could be revised to ensure comparable
      replies?
  - answer: One such revision could be the introduction of a word limit to ensure
      that all Member States provide comparable levels of detail in their replies.
    question: What could be a revision to Question 8 (b) to ensure comparable replies?
- context: The main limitation of this exercise is that the actual implementation
    measures on the different points listed in the Questionnaire or, furthermore,
    the extent to which this implementation indicates compliance with the obligations
    of the Directive, is not directly assessed. In order for such due diligence to
    take place, Member States should be required to submit evidence along with their
    answers to the Implementation Questionnaires. An assessment of compliance could
    then take place using the Member State replies and the evidence submitted to determine
    if the obligations of the Directive had been met, allowing scoring Member States
    according to their implementation status. If this was the case, Member States
    would be able to submitted additional or even contradictory evidence to refine
    the assessment for each reporting period.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The main limitation of this exercise is that the actual implementation
      measures on the different points listed in the Questionnaire or, furthermore,
      the extent to which this implementation indicates compliance with the obligations
