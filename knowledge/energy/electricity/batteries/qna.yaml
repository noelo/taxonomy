seed_examples:
  - question: Do LFP batteries contain cobalt?
    answer: |
      LFP batteries are cobalt-free.
  - question: What is the Maximum Cell charge voltage?
    answer: |
      Between 3.60 Volts to 3.65 Volts.
  - question: What is the maximim number of charge cycles for a LFP battery?
    answer: |
      Usually around 10,000 cycles.
  - question: What is the specific energy of LFP batteries?
    answer: |
      The specific energy of LFP batteries range between 125 Watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg)
      to 160 Wh/kg depending on the packing technology used.
  - question: What is the nominal output of an LFP battery?
    answer: |
      The nominal output is 3.2 Volts.
  - question: What other lithium-ion battery chemistries are there?
    answer: |
      cobalt (LiCo2) or manganese spinel (LiMn2O4) lithium-ion polymer batteries (LiPo battery)
  - question: Are LiFePO4 a fire hazard?
    answer: |
      No, LiFePO4 cells are harder to ignite in the event of mishandling and the LiFePO4 battery
      does not decompose at high temperatures.
