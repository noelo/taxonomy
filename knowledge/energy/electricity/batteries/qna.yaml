    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What other lithium-ion battery chemistries are there?
        answer: |
          cobalt (LiCo2) or manganese spinel (LiMn2O4) lithium-ion polymer batteries (LiPo battery)
      - question: Are LiFePO4 a fire hazard?
        answer: |
          No, LiFePO4 cells are harder to ignite in the event of mishandling and the LiFePO4 battery
          does not decompose at high temperatures.
      - question: What safety advantages do LiFePO4 batteries have over other lithium-ion ?
        answer: |
          No, LiFePO4 cells are harder to ignite in the event of mishandling and the LiFePO4 battery
          does not decompose at high temperatures.
